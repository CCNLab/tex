Instructions for using epsf files in tex:


1. \input epsf   just after documentstyle.

2. Use this sequence for figures (assuming you want them centered)

\begin{figure}
\centering \leavevmode
\epsfbox{ <filename>}
\caption{  <caption> }
\label{ <ref> }
\end{figure}

3. for re-sizing, you have to know how wide or tall you want it:

\epsfxsize=<dimen> \epsfbox{ <filename> }

\epsfysize=<dimen> \epsfbox{ <filename> }

and the figure will be re-scaled appropriately, preserving its aspect
ratio.

Specify <dimen> as a number and a unit of measure, such as

\epsfysize=4in
