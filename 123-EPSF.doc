To make Lotus 123 "Encoded" PS files into EPSF format, do the following:

1. set page setup to EPSFPORTRAIT

2. use	18/18 point font for title,
	14/12 point font for everything else.

3. do /print/encoded/ to a file

4. edit the end of the resulting file, which should have:

%%EndObject
rs sp
%%Page: 2 2
sv
%%BeginPageSetup
0

as the final lines.  Cut everything below %%Page: 2 2, and add the
word "end":

%%EndObject
rs sp
end

5. either run the results through pstoepsi to get an encapsulated file
with the appropriate boundingbox and a "preview" image (very nice for
including in FrameMaker, etc):

pstoepsi name.ps name.eps

-OR-, if you want to save space and not have the preview image:

6. set header to EPSF and:
7. set bounding box to the last four values in the %%BeginObject:
command

eg:

%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2
%%BoundingBox: 0 7 360 367
