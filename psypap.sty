%% psychpap.sty
%%	Stanford Psychology APA'ish style for papers.
%%	Modifications to Latex article style
%%	9/10/90 MAM & RLM
%%
%%	Use this style to get APA formatted papers, with figures,
%%	tables, and footnotes integrated into the text.  If you are
%%	submitting a paper for publication to a journal requiring APA 
%%	format, use suapapub.sty.  That style floats all tables and
%%	figures to the end, and makes footnotes be endnotes, etc.
%%
%%	This style makes several important changes to LaTeX's article 
%%	style.  It is meant to be used as an optional style as follows:
%%		\documentstyle[?????]{article}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% doublespace.sty
%%	APA style submissions should be doublespaced.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input doublespace.sty
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% fancyheadings.sty
%%	Allows things like multi-line headers, running heads, etc.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input fancyheadings.sty
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Section headings
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The default is to handle 3 levels of sectioning.  APA heading styles
% change slightly depending on whether 3 or 4 levels of headings are
% used in a paper.  To use 4 levels of headings, specify (???) as a
% \documentstyle option.

% APA Level 2
% change Section heading to large, centered
\renewcommand{\section}{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{3.5ex plus
1ex minus .2ex}{2.3ex plus .2ex}{\large\centering}*}

% APA Level 4
% change Subsection heading to large, italic, flushleft
\renewcommand{\subsection}{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}{3.25ex
plus 1ex minus .2ex}{1.5ex plus .2ex}{\large\it}*}

% APA Level 5
% change Subsubsection to normalsize, italic, run-in
\renewcommand{\subsubsection}{\@startsection{subsubsection}{3}{\parindent
}{-3.25ex plus -1ex minus -.2ex}{-1.0em}{\it}*}
