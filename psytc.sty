%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The default is to handle 3 levels of sectioning.  APA heading styles
% change slightly depending on whether 3 or 4 levels of headings are
% used in a paper.  To use 4 levels of headings, specify (???) as a
% \documentstyle option.

% ROR 9/14/92:
% modified to change default section commands to section* versions,
% that also add table of contents entries, but still allow for
% explicit * entries that have to refer to the \psy version of the
% section command

% APA Level 1
% Section heading is Large, centered
\def\psysection{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}
{2ex plus 1ex minus .2ex}{1.3ex plus .2ex}
{\large\centering}}

% APA Level 2
% Subsection heading to large, italic, flushleft
\def\psysubsection{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}
{1.0ex plus 1ex minus .2ex}{0.5ex plus \parskip}
{\large\it}}

\renewcommand{\subsection}[1]{\psysubsection*{#1}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{#1}}

% APA Level 3
% Subsubsection is normalzize, italic, runin, indexed
