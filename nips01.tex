% The \author macro works with any number of authors.
% There are two commands used to separate the names and addresses of
% multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where
% to break the lines.  Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point.
% So, if \LaTeX{} puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the
% last on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before
% the third author name.


\begin{document}

\maketitle



\begin{abstract}
The Abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2~inch (3~picas) on
both left and right-hand margins. Use 10~point type, with a
vertical spacing of 11~points. The word  {\bf Abstract} must be centered,
bold, and in point size 12. Two line spaces precede the Abstract.
The Abstract must be limited to one paragraph.
\end{abstract}

\section{Submission of papers to NIPS*99} 
NIPS is modifying its submission procedure, in the
process of migrating to an electronic submission system. THE SUBMISSION PROCESS
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE USED IN THE PAST. This year we require BOTH
electronic and hard copy submissions. Please read carefully the instructions
below, and follow them faithfully. Your collaboration is greatly appreciated,
as it will help us through the implementation of a new system that will become
fully electronic for NIPS*2000.

Papers to be submitted to NIPS*99 must be prepared according to the 
instructions presented here. Papers may be only up to SEVEN pages 
long, including figures and references. This is a strict upper 
bound. Papers that exceed seven pages will not be reviewed, or in any other 
way considered for presentation at the conference.

Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable either 
at the NIPS website or by anonymous FTP, as indicated below. 
THE STYLE FILES HAVE BEEN UPDATED; please make sure that you use the 
current ones and not previous versions.

HARD-COPY SUBMISSION: A complete hard-copy submission consists 
of FOUR copies of the paper, 
accompanied by a front page that must specify (1) name, physical address, 
and email address of all authors; (2) the name of the author to whom 
correspondence should be addressed; (3) the category to which the paper 
is being submitted, chosen among the nine major categories listed below; 
(4) the authors' preference, if any, for oral or poster presentation 
(this preference will play no role in paper acceptance); and (5) whether 
the work, or any substantial part thereof, has been submitted
to or presented at any other scientific conference.

Hard-copy submissions must be mailed to: \\ 

Todd K. Leen  \\
NIPS*99 Program Chair \\
Department of Computer Science and Engineering \\
Oregon Graduate Institute of Science \& Technology \\
20000 N.W. Walker Rd. \\
Beaverton, OR 97006, USA \\

ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION: In addition to mailing four hard copies, you MUST enter
your submission in the Electronic Submission Form available at the NIPS
website listed below. This will be your PRIMARY submission, and the Electronic
Submission Form must be completed in all cases. You will be asked to enter
paper title, name of all authors, category, oral/poster preference, and data
about the contact author (name, full address, telephone, fax, and email). You
will also be able to upload an electronic (postscript or pdf) version of your
paper. You MUST mail four hard copies of your paper to Todd Leen, the NIPS*99
Program Chair, even if you succeed at uploading the electronic version of your
paper during electronic submission.

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS MUST BE LOGGED BY MAY 21, 1999,
AND HARD COPIES MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE SAME DATE. Hard copy submissions mailed
from within the USA via first class mail will be accepted if postmarked on or

before May 18, 1999.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}
The style files for NIPS, the Electronic Submission Page, and other
conference information are available on the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/NIPS
\end{center}
Copies of the style files are also available via anonymous ftp at
\begin{center}
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.206.173) in /afs/cs/Web/Groups/NIPS/formatting
\end{center}
The file \verb+nips.ps+ contains these instructions and illustrates 
the various formatting requirements that your NIPS paper must 
satisfy. \LaTeX{} users can choose between two style files: 
\verb+nips99.sty+ (to be used with \LaTeX{} version 2.09) and 
\verb+nips99e.sty+ (to be used with \LaTeX{}2e). The file 
\verb+nips99.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing 
your paper.  All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, 
and text of the paper with your own. 
The file \verb+nips99.rtf+ is provided for MS Word users. 

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are 
summarized in sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
\ref{others} below. 

\subsection{Categories for paper submission}
Your NIPS paper can be submitted to any of the following nine 
categories: 

\begin{verbatim}
Algorithms and Architectures
Applications
Cognitive Science/Artificial Intelligence
Implementations
Neuroscience
Reinforcement Learning and Control
Speech and Signal Processing
Theory
Visual Processing
\end{verbatim}

A description of each category (by examples) can 
be found in the Call for Papers at the NIPS website 
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/NIPS). 

\section{General formatting instructions} 
\label{gen_inst}
The text must be confined within a rectangle 5~inches (30~picas) wide 
and 8.25~inches (49.5~picas) long. The left margin is
1.75~inches (10.5~picas). Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing
of 11~points. Times Roman is the preferred typeface throughout.
One-half line space between paragraphs, with no indent.

Paper title is 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered between
2~horizontal rules.  Top rule is 4~points thick and bottom rule is
1~point thick. Allow 1/4~inch space above and below title to rules.
The first rule is 1.1~inches (6.6~picas) from the top of the page.
Subsequent pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of
the page. 

Authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is centered above
the corresponding address.   The lead author's name
is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow.  If only one co-author,
list both  author and co-author side by side.

Please pay special
attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}  regarding
figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

First level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper 
nouns), flush left, bold and in point
size 12. One line space before the first level heading and 1/2~line
space after the first level heading.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper 
nouns), flush left, bold and in point
size 10. One line space before the second level heading and
1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper
nouns), flush left, bold and in point
size 10. One line space before the third level heading and
1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}
These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the 
formatter being used. 

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be numbered consecutively. 
The corresponding number is to appear enclosed in square 
brackets, such as [1] or [2]-[5]. The corresponding references 
are to be listed in the same order at the end of the paper, 
in the {\bf References} section. Any standard reference style 
is acceptable, as long as it is used consistently. 

\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second
footnote} 

\subsection{Figures} 

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible.  Lines
should be dark enough for purposes of reproduction; art work
should not be hand-drawn.  Figure number and caption always appear
after the figure.  Place one line space before the figure caption,
and one line space after the figure. The figure caption is lower 
case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are 
numbered consecutively. 

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
figure. Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and 
figure caption.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{1in}
\caption{Sample figure caption}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use
hand-drawn tables. Table number and title always appear before the
table.
See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title
must be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns);  
tables are numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Sample table title}
\label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION}
\\ \hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}
Do not change ANY aspects of the formatting parameters in the 
style files. In particular: do not modify the width or length 
of the rectangle that the text should fit into, and do not 
change font sizes (except perhaps in the {\bf References} section; 
see below). Leave pages unnumbered. 

For submission purposes, and to save on trees,
papers can be printed double-sided. Please staple
together each copy of your paper, separately from
the other copies.



\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments.  All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper.


\subsubsection*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments.  Use unnumbered third level
heading for the references.  Any choice of citation style is
acceptable as long as you are consistent. It is permissible 
to reduce the font size to `small' when listing the references.
